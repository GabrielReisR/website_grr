## BFI dataset

We'll use the Big-Five Inventory dataset to compare two networks based on
gender (Male vs. Female). After computing each network, we'll check to see
if both networks differ.

# Data:
df <- bfi[,1:26]

df$gender %<>% factor(levels = 1:2,
                      labels = c("Male", "Female"))
```

## Estimating networks with bootnet

First, we'll estimate both networks using the same procedure and store each
network in a bootnet object. Then, we'll use these objects to compare our
networks.

Let's estimate both networks:

```{r Estimating both networks, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
network_male <- estimateNetwork(df %>% 
                                  filter(gender == "Male") %>% 
                                  select(-gender),
                                default = "EBICglasso",
                                corMethod = "spearman")

network_female <- estimateNetwork(df %>%
                                    filter(gender == "Female") %>% 
                                    select(-gender),
                                  default = "EBICglasso",
                                  corMethod = "spearman")
```

Note that we used *dplyr* to filter each network's own gender and then removed
said gender from the Spearman correlation procedure.
Now that we have our networks, let's begin our comparison procedures.

## Checking invariant network structure

When doing this, what we basically want is to know if there are great
differences between both networks' edges. To know our highest difference value,
the *M* statistic, we just run:

```{r Getting to the M statistic, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
M <-
  max(
    abs(c(network_male$graph) - c(network_female$graph))
  )

cat("The biggest edge difference is:", M)
```

That doesn't say much to us because this may be a fluke. Say one unique edge 
presented this difference, but the rest of the network is invariant. To test if
this difference is significant, a permutation test is used. The following steps
are performed using the package *NetworkComparisonTest*:

1. Create a sample based on random selection considering the whole dataset - 
that is, participants from the first and second networks.
2. Compute a network with the same estimation procedures.
3. Compute this unified sample's network *M* statistic and store it.
4. Repeat this *n* times.

If M is significant, at least one edge difference supposedly exists between the
two groups, since this difference didn't show up when our samples were
permutated. In [Running *NetworkComparisonTest*]()

## Checking invariant global strength

Another important aspect is general network strength. Say one network is more
activated than the other. We can test that too. This statistic is called *S*.
Let's check strength difference between one network and the other.

```{r Getting to the S statistic, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
S <-
  abs(
    sum(
      abs(c(network_male$graph)) -
        abs(c(network_female$graph))
    )
  )/2

cat("Strength difference between the two networks is:", S)
```

Note that we divide the difference between the sum of absolute values from the
two networks by 2. This is because we're trying to work with only one part of
the matrix - the lower or upper half - since the weights matrix is square and
symmetric.

Again, we don't know if this value of S is significant or not. To test if this
difference is significant, a permutation test is used. The following steps are
performed using the package *NetworkComparisonTest*:

1. Create a sample based on random selection considering the whole dataset - 
that is, participants from the first and second networks.
2. Compute a network with the same estimation procedures.
3. Compute this unified sample's network *S* statistic and store it.
4. Repeat this *n* times.

If S is significant, the strength difference we noted would have a low 
probability of happening in a world where there isn't a strength difference
between the two groups.

## Running and reporting *NetworkComparisonTest*

To run these tests, the function is in fact very simple.

```{r Running nct_results again, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(123) # random permutation seed
nct_results <- NCT(network_male, network_female,
                   it = 1000,
                   progressbar = F)

nct_results
```

Below, how to report NCT analysis plan and results (only NCT, for how to report
estimation procedures with bootnet, check
<a href= "https://reisrgabriel.com/blog/2021-09-27-bootnet/#reporting-our-findings" target="_blank">**this**</a>).

### Data Analysis

Comparison between the two groups were performed using the 
*NetworkComparisonTest* package (NCT; van Borkulo et al., 2017; vers√£o 2.2.1)
with a permutation seed value of '123'. Based on 1000 permutations, we
investigated network invariance (possible edge weight differences) and global
strength invariance (possible difference on the absolute sum of network edge
weights).

### Results

From NCT analyses, we observed that networks seem to be the same for the two
groups since *M* = 0.095, *p* = .545, and *S* = 1.405 with *p* = .364.


## Checking invariant edge strength

If our *M* was significant, we could ask for *post hoc* analyses. Van Borkulo et
al. (2017) recommend checking possible edge differences using Bonferroni-Holm 
correction. We could directly ask for that, but we'd have to perform another
NCT analyses now asking directly for specific edge differences to be tested.

```{r Testing specific edge weights differences, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
nct_test_edges <- NCT(network_male, network_female, 
                      it = 1000, test.edges = T,
                      p.adjust.methods = "BH",
                      progressbar = F)
```

## Checking which edges are different

When we test specific edge differences, we end up with a long object of all
possible tests. I created a function to organize only edge differences with a 
*p* equal to or below .05 (this can be changed using the *alpha* argument:

```{r Checking which edges are different, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
difference_value <- function(NCT, alpha = 0.05){
  
  diff_edges <- NCT$einv.pvals %>% dplyr::filter(`p-value` <= alpha)
  
  for (i in 1:nrow(diff_edges)) {
    var_1 <- as.character(diff_edges[i, 1])
    var_2 <- as.character(diff_edges[i, 2])
    
    value_net_1 <- NCT$nw1[var_1, var_2]
    value_net_2 <- NCT$nw2[var_1, var_2]
    
    abs_difference <- abs(value_net_1 - value_net_2)
    p_value <- diff_edges$`p-value`[i]
    
    cat("Test Edge", i, "\n----\n")
    cat(var_1, "and", var_2)
    cat("\nNetwork 1:", value_net_1,
        "\nNetwork 2:", value_net_2)
    cat("\nAbsolute difference:", abs_difference,
        "with p-value =", p_value, "\n----\n")
  }
}

difference_value(nct_test_edges)
```

It seems that even though the networks seem to be invariant, two edges are 
different. Again, this procedure is somewhat useless if *M* is not significant.
Then again, if *M* was significant, one could report in the Results section:

Bonferroni-Holm correction was used to access potential diferent edges between
the two networks. Edges "C3--E2" ("Do things according to a plan" -- "Find it
difficult to approach others") and "A4--E5" ("Love children" -- "Take charge")
showed statistically significant differences (*p* < .001). Male participants
didn't present edges "C3--E2" (with strength 0.042 in the female network) while
female participants didn't manifest edge "A4--E5" (with strength 0.057 in the
male network).


## Checking invariance of centrality measures

We could also investigate potential centrality differences. To do that, let's
change the argument `test.centrality` to `TRUE`.

```{r Checking invariance of centrality measures, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nct_test_centrality <- NCT(network_male, network_female,
                           it = 1000, test.centrality = T,
                           p.adjust.methods = "BH",
                           centrality = c("closeness",
                                          "betweenness",
                                          "strength",
                                          "expectedInfluence"),
                           progressbar = F)
```

Now, if we want to check if some centrality measure is statistically different,
we run `nct_test_centrality$diffcen.pval` to get our adjusted *p* values:

```{r Which centrality measures are statistically different}
nct_test_centrality$diffcen.pval
```
