  I'm a 27-year old Brazilian interested in psychometrics that's been involved 
  in academia for about 8 years. Currently I'm a MSc Student in Psychology 
  looking to update and help the psychology field in developing and revising
  psychological methods. Moreover, I'm an advocate for open science and enjoy 
  sharing what I learn. Also, lately I've been interested in network 
  psychometrics.
  
  On a more personal note, I love theater and music. Did a few gigs and plays as
  an actor/musician and my favorite play is Hamilton.
